# 📩Real time cryto prediction

This project is an **SMS spam classifier** built on top of a fine-tuned **GPT-2-based language model**. It leverages modern tooling in Python, such as `pydantic`, `loguru`, `ruff`, and `make`, to deliver a clean, maintainable, and scalable machine learning pipeline.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Fine-tuned **GPT-2** model for binary SMS classification (spam vs ham)
- 🔄 **Balanced dataset** preprocessing
- 🛡️ **Pydantic** for robust data validation
- 📊 Dataset metrics and confusion matrix visualization
- 📦 Tooling includes `ruff`, `loguru`, and `make` for linting, logging, and workflow automation
